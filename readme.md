# Trail - 4th Year CompSci Dissertation Project
A Progressive Web App (PWA) that allows a user to get information about the trees on the Heriot-Watt using QR, Spatial and Speech Synth technologies.
Augmented Reality is also experimented with.
* Work In Progress Deployed at: https://www.thetrailapp.com/

## Stack

### Hosting
Trail is hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and has a full valid SSH certification as well as a custom domain.
- Heroku also hosts the applications database.
- Heroku builds and deploys the web application automatically.

### Database
Trail makes use of a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database with the [postGIS](https://postgis.net/) extension installed for the ability to query and store geospatial data.

### Backend
This web application is powered by Golang v1.13.1 and handles the following:
* File serving
* Page routing, made easier by the use of the [Gin-Gonic/gin framework](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin)
* Database connection and querying (using [Go-SQL-driver](https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql)
* Outlining package details and dependencies to Heroku for hosting

### Front-end
To make this web app usable and pretty the following technologies are used:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript (to provide more complex functionality and handle API calls)
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com/)
* [Material Design Bootstrap](https://mdbootstrap.com/) (to make everything that little bit easier)

### APIs
* [Google Maps Javascript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overview) is used to generate custom, cross-compatible, interactive maps.

### JavaScript Libraries
* [html5-qrcode](https://blog.minhazav.dev/HTML5-QR-Code-scanning-launched-v1.0.1/#how-to-use) by Minhaz - this library was crucial in development and allowed for a QR code scanner to be embedded into the web application.
* [WriteIT.js](https://khushit-shah.github.io/WriteIt.js/) by khushit-shah - used for the homepage greeting.
* Google Maps' [Marker Clusterer Library](https://googlemaps.github.io/v3-utility-library/classes/_google_markerclustererplus.markerclusterer.html)
* [SpeechSynthesis Web Speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesis) - used for text to speech synthesis
* [User Agent Parser](https://github.com/faisalman/ua-parser-js) by faisalman on GitHub - used to get the users operating system to prevent vibration API functions calling when a user is running web app on an IOS or Mac OS device. (vibration API. is unsupported by IOS)
* [AR.js](https://github.com/AR-js-org/AR.js) - Augmetented Reality Web Framework
